Google.Auth
===========
A C#/.NET Library for using Google Authentication

It should work on Mono, though I haven't tested it there yet.  It does NOT depend on System.Web, so hopefully it works fine on MonoTouch and MonoDroid and all the Xamarin stuff :)

What's Working:
--------
- OAuth 3-Legged


What doesn't exist yet:
-----------------------
- OAuth 2-Legged
- AuthSub
